To run this program, you must have the following installed on your machine:
+ Python
+ The following pip installs:
    -> pip install google-api-python-client
    -> pip install python-vlc
    -> pip install youtube-dl
    -> pip install pafy
    -> pip install requests
+ VLC Media Player

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to organize all the installs.
Once you have all the programs and pip modules installed, run the main.py
file on your machine. This program sends requests to a YouTube API, therefore
the amount of requests per day are limited.

If we had more time to build onto the project, we would have implemented a 
previous song button and displayed the result video instead of just the 
thumbnail.
